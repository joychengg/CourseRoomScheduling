Contributions: Implemented functions together and committed on one computer, we splitted work of testing and debugging.

Testing: https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team21/commit/fa9e56efb879551ccd061958731c209f924f37bc

Retrospective: This deliverable was challenging because we had to get familiar with a new language, also we had to start everything and build the project from scratch. We started very early and was still debugging on the last day. For the next deliverable, we would approach it differently by going to TA hours earlier in the week so its not too crowded, as well as reading the specs carefully before starting so we don't write code that doesn't fulfill the specs.
