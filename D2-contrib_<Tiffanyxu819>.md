Retrospective: This deliverable was challenging because we were stuck on Lat and Lon for quiet some time trying to get promises working correctly. Overall it was less challenging than the last deliverable and we were able to finish a few days before the deadline. For the next deliverable we would continue consistent work like this time and try to refactor more of our code.
