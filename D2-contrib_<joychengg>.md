Final test pass rate: 98% Â  Coverage rate: 92%


Contribution:
I participated in writing addDataset, performQuery, and help edited removeDataset.
There was constant effort for both of us to debug as well.
I also helped write the helper methods for performQuery.
I helped writing some of the test cases.

I finished addDataset: https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team21/commit/0df5a86e438216aa028e594dab7f11e46c0e4a1d

I was half way finishing performQuery's helper:

I was writing extra helper methods for our filter method, also I was starting to write tests:

I was fixing bugs in our overall implementation and writing more test cases:

I was writing more check methods for our filter:
https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team21/commit/3507b151234da0736a82d4657d6d42f181bd263f

later on commits mostly on bug fixing and writing more test cases.

Overall this deliverable was fun, but definitely difficult. We started the day it was released; we were ahead of most groups in the first week in the sense that we finished the addDataset and was contemplating on performQuery already. However, we didn't realize performQuery was a lot more complex than we thought, so that took us a long time. As the final week approached, more students went to TA hours, so it was hard for us to make any progress at TA hour. Right before the deadline we realized there was some serious bug in our implementation, and was also when we realized Piazza wasn't helpful. I would definitely still start the next deliverable early. I would also read the specs more carefully and maybe just go over it with a TA to clarify everything before we start.
