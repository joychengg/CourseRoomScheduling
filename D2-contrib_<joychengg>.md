Overall this deliverable was fun. There were definitely some difficult points that we struggled for a long time, but we got through them as a team and we learned so much about team work. We definitely were better on the communication level because we didn't have much redundant work this time. We are also able to share and appreciate each other's ideas on how to approach parts of the project. I don't think there is much to stress on for improvement because we got to know each other better and it was a pleasure to work with my partner.
